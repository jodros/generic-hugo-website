# A generic Hugo website

This repository is a reduced and clean version of my own personal website and contains the fundamental files to create a [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)-based blog.

Instead of loading fonts from Google Fonts, they are self hosted and were embedded with help of [this website](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts).

It has a simple i18n support and a light-dark mode switcher.
